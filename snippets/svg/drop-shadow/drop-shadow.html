				This is our definition for the drop shadow filter.
				We give it an ID so that it can be referenced 
				(and applied on) multiple objects.

				The `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` attributes
				control the area our filter can be rendered onto.

				Since the drop shadow can potentially be pointed at a large distance 
				in any direction, we're giving it extra legroom by leaving 
				50% in each direction. (These are all defined proportionally to the object).

					1. The first primitive is a Gaussian blur:
						- it takes as an input the original graphic
						  (we only need the alpha channel, thus in='SourceAlpha')
						- it blurs the input by a factor of 10 (stdDeviation)
						- it outputs its result as `blur`
				-->
				<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="10" in='SourceAlpha' result='blur'/>
				
				<!--
					2. Next, we use the feOffset primitive
					to take the output from `blur` and offset it by 10,10.
					The output is called `offset_blur`.

					BTW, if you wanted to have your drop shadow defined as a single
					distance + direction of light (expressed in degrees), then you'd 
					have to set:
						- dx = distance * Math.sin(degrees * Math.PI / 180)
						- dy = distance * Math.cos(degrees * Math.PI / 180)
				-->
				<feOffset dx="10" dy="10" in='blur' result='offset_blur'/>
				
				<!--
					3. On the other hand, we want our drop shadow to have 
					a specific color and opacity, for which we use a feFlood primitive.
					The result is called `flood`.
				-->
				<feFlood flood-color="#000" flood-opacity="0.75" result='flood'/>

				<!--
					4. We combine the `offset_blur` (Step 2) and `flood` (Step 3)
					into our final effect, called `drop_shadow`.
				-->
				<feComposite operator="in" in='flood' in2="offset_blur" result='drop_shadow'/>
				
				<!--
					5. Finally, we need to display both our original object
					and its drop shadow, so we use feMerge to combine the two.
					First is `drop_shadow` (because we want it underneath),
					and then the `SourceGraphic` on top.
